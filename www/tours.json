Originally thought to be a restaurant or delicatessen, between 1935 and 1941 this building was home to Blossom Dairy, a chain of local dairy stores that featured classic Art Deco styling and served up the famous \"Mammoth Milkshake\" (Blossom Dairy's \"Super Store No. 7\" opened in 1941 at 904 Quarrier St., where it remains in total Art Deco splendor). Spence Paint Company moved into 1600 Washington St. in 1941 and remained until its closure over 50 years later. After sitting vacant for a time, the building changed hands in 2005. The new owners have tirelessly rehabilitated it, exposing the original pressed tin ceiling on the interior, converting the second floor to artist's studios and adding new exterior awnings. Now, this once busy commercial corner has come back to life, wonderfully transformed into a very popular local eatery called \"Bluegrass Kitchen\".

In 1908 the congregation purchased the former State (Lee) Street Methodist Church and used it for services until 1949, when the present B'nai Jacob Synagogue was built. A national demand for new synagogues after World War II created a building boom of modem community centers designed to serve a variety of social, educational and religious needs. In keeping with this trend, B'nai Jacob cast off traditional European styles and embraced the new architectural form featuring Art Deco and Modernist elements that meld with the vernacular corpus of the building. Those architectural details form a solid surround for a spectacular series of six stunning stained glass panels that grace the entryway. Designed by local artist David Pushkin, the windows display representative symbolism from the Torah. They give an interpretation of the Creation story, one window for each of the six days named by the artist: Light, Firmament, Seeds, Luminaries, Living Soul, and Let Us Make Man; the work in its entirety represents the seventh day. In Hebrew tradition, the windows are properly viewed on the inside from the right to left. To fully appreciate their fine artistry, visitors are invited to step inside the synagogue and view them on a clear day. They may be seen on arrangement by calling (304) 346-4722.&quot;]\" data-sheets-userformat=\"[null,null,8320,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,2,null,null,null,null,null,10]\">Charleston's Orthodox Jewish community was organized in the 1890s\u00a0by Eastern European immigrants who held services in private homes and later in a rented hall.
